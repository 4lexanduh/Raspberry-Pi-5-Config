#Install Raspberry Pi OS via Raspberry Pi Imager

#Configure SSH and WiFi settings from Imager

#If public key access denied, follow these steps

  #1. Find your public key (use terminal on pc you want to ssh from)
        #     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  

  #2. Using Linux VM, install VMware Tools. Then reboot VM. This allows copy/paste from main pc. (public key is very long. we dont want to type it)
        #     sudo apt update
        #     sudo apt install open-vm-tools-desktop -y
        #     sudo reboot


  #3 Mount your Raspberry Pi boot SD Card to Linux VM.
  
 
  #4 In Linux terminal type (* = local profile on raspberry pi):
        #     cd /media/ubuntu/rootfs/home/*


  #5 Make .ssh folder and edit authorized keys
        #    sudo mkdir -p .ssh
        #    sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys


  #6 Paste your public key from the step 1 output. Then hit ctrl+x, enter, ctrl+o


  #7 Change permissions and ownership
        #    sudo chmod 700 .ssh
        #    sudo chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
        #    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 .ssh


#SSH should work now!!
